# Idris Code Examples

Basic steps to take:

 * Install Idris.
 * Make all of the shell scripts runnable (chmod).
 * Use run command to execute programs.


I amm most interested in Idris for use in generating portable source code in the form of JS! But the following topics are of interest.

 * FFI
 * Type level programming.
 * Effect systems.

And here's some code! :+1:

```shell
cd <example>
./run.sh
```

### Stuff used to make this:

 * [idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/) for Markdown parsing
 * [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the awesome syntax-highlighted editor
